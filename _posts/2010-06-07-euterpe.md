Some time ago I decided I needed a tool that would synchronize my music with my player. I required several very simple things from it:

 - encode music automatically into a supported format,
 - save encoded files somewhere, in case it ever needs to be encoded for a second time,
 - the tracks to be transferred are selected in a non-brain-exploding manner.

I failed to find a tool that does exactly this. So I simply had to write my own! This ultimately led to a simple music-synchronization framework. Unfortunately I didn't have the strength to make a decent product out of it, so I'll simply show you what I've done.

If you want to use it and/or improve it, I'll be very glad.

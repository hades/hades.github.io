Have a look at my git repository to see some of the things I've been working on
just for fun:

[https://git.hades.name](https://git.hades.name)

Note that the code is largely undocumented, and most probably won't even work.

There are more detailed descriptions for some of the projects:

 * [Bird](/bird/), a simple, extendable Python client for Twitter.
 * [vbox-runner](/vbox-runner/), a KDE KRunner applet that launches VirtualBox
   virtual machines,
 * [Furl](/furl/), a universal URL collector,
 * [Watchbot](/watchbot/), a monitor for services and servers,
 * [Euterpe](/euterpe/), a music synchronization framework,
 * [Aeacus](/aeacus/), my overlay for Gentoo Linux.

There is also a [CookBook](/cookbook/) with some code snippets and whatnot.

If you want to contact me, use the following e-mail: development@hades.name
